 <h2 style="text-align:center;color:blue;"> Global positioning system(GPS) </h2>
 <p> <i>The Global positioning system(GPS) is a space based satellite navigation system to locate positions (in terms of longitude,hieght and time coordinates) of objects anywhere on the earth.</i> This system was developed in 1973 and became operational in 1995.<br> <b>Constituents of GPS System </b> <br> the various components of GPS are : space segment, controt segment and user segment <br> <b> The space segment :</b> The space segment consists of a constellation of 24 satellites (equipedd with atomic clocks accurate to within 3 nano seconds)orbiying around the earth in circular orbits about 20200KM above the earth.Earth satellite completes one orbit in 12hours.These satellites are arranged in six orbital planes and each plane containing four to five satellites is tiltedat 55 <sup> o</sup> relative to the equater . At least four  satellites are insight at any time from any place on the earth.Each satellite contains a computer , a radio transmission system, solar panels, batteries etc. The satellites transmit radio signals that provide information about the location and time of the satellites.The radio signals are broadcasted using two carrier frequencies of 1575.42 MHz and 1227.60MHz.These signals are not affected by rain, fog and snow transmitted by satellites are used to calculate the distance of the satellite from the GPS reciever by using the formulla s=ct, where c=speed of light and t is the time taken by the signal to reach the reciever.
